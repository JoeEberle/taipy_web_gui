# Machine Learning with Taipy Web GUI and TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to use **Taipy** to build a **web-based graphical user interface (GUI)** that integrates with **TensorFlow** machine learning models. The notebook `taipy_web_gui.ipynb` showcases how you can design interactive applications with Taipy, allowing users to interact with ML models through a web interface, making the machine learning workflow more accessible and intuitive.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **Taipy** can be used to create dynamic, web-based applications that interact seamlessly with **TensorFlow** models. This allows for real-time data visualization, model predictions, and easy interaction with machine learning processes, all within a browser-based GUI.

**Taipy** is a Python framework for creating interactive applications, dashboards, and user interfaces. Combined with **TensorFlow**, this enables developers to build machine learning models and deploy them in a user-friendly web interface without requiring deep web development expertise.

## Features

- Web-based user interface built using **Taipy**.
- Integration with **TensorFlow** for machine learning predictions.
- Real-time data visualization and model output in the browser.
- Easy-to-understand interface for interacting with machine learning models.
- Customizable for different machine learning tasks, such as classification or regression.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taipy_web_gui.git
   cd taipy_web_gui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary Python packages via `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Key Dependencies**:
   - **Taipy**
   - **TensorFlow**
   - **Pandas**
   - **Matplotlib**

   Ensure you have a compatible version of Python (3.7+ recommended).

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook taipy_web_gui.ipynb
   ```

2. **Start the Taipy Web Application**:

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to initialize and run the Taipy web server. This will allow you to interact with the TensorFlow models through a web-based GUI in your browser.

3. **Interact with the ML Models**:

   Use the web GUI to upload datasets, modify model parameters, and view predictions in real-time. The interface will allow you to visualize data, train models, and make predictions using TensorFlow models integrated into the backend.

## Project Overview

This project integrates **Taipy** and **TensorFlow** into a single solution, where:

- **Taipy** handles the frontend, providing a web-based interface for users.
- **TensorFlow** performs machine learning tasks such as training and prediction in the backend.
- The notebook walks you through the steps of creating a machine learning model in TensorFlow and deploying it via Taipy for user interaction.

## Taipy Workflow

Taipy is used in this project to:

- Create a **dynamic GUI** that allows users to upload data and interact with machine learning models.
- Build a **dashboard** to display real-time visualizations of input data and model performance.
- Run **interactive model predictions** based on user inputs.

## TensorFlow Integration

- The **TensorFlow** models in this project handle machine learning tasks such as classification or regression. You can train, test, and deploy TensorFlow models using the Taipy interface.
- TensorFlow’s flexible architecture makes it possible to integrate a wide range of models, from simple linear regressions to deep neural networks, which are controlled via the Taipy GUI.
